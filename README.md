# ScoutBadgeTrackerConsole
Desktop application for ScoutBadgeTracker with Vue 3.
Should have all the functionality as ScoutBadgeTracker with additional desktop features.
ScoutBadgeTracker is intened as a mobile app. Its HTML and CSS are expected to diverge 
from ScoutBadgeTrackerConsole. At some point shared functionality will be refactored to
a shared library.
